## Random Lua Stuff for PSP (2019-2020?)
Sadly no specific information or files about this but IIRC those were just some simple menus for games that I never started to develop.
## GMOD CoD SWEPS for Trickshotting (Jul 23, 2021 - Aug 8, 2023)
Ported Call of Duty TFA/CW2 SWEPS on Steam Workshop to M9K weapon base (using Lua and a bit of Source engine modding knowledge) to make trickshotting on GMOD easier. Also made a mod menu-ish addon called SteezMod which was a menu for configuring stuff for trickshotting. I still have the files but not sharing them to the public for obvious reasons.
## reha's flash0 EBOOT Launcher (~2022)
This was my first attempt on trying to write C stuff without learning about it on PSP... The homebrew doesn't even work at all. [It was ridiculous](https://x.com/pspcpu/status/1781113282541076846) but definitely a piece of history for myself.
## psp-stackless-button-tester (Aug 16, 2022)
Just a practice project to get started with Python development. It's so random.
## pyident (Aug 17, 2022)
My attempt on replicating pspident in Python (which didn't go well of course...). The ICON0 is really cool though.
## luatoolbox (Jan 13, 2023)
A PSP hardware tester written in Lua. I never felt like completing it.
## OpenSpeed (Feb 17, 2023)
My first decent C project (FYI this existed way before they decided to add FinalSpeed to ARK-4). I've figured out the basic file IO stuff on C thanks to this homebrew!
## spoofix (Jun 11, 2023)
Another PSP project in C. It's still on my GitHub page because I don't want the [GameBrew](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Spoofix_PSP) source link to be broken. Replacing the version string in version.txt to 5.50 is the proper way, my homebrew replaces the whole version.txt instead but this doesn't really cause any issue and still solves the specified problem. The important thing about this is that this homebrew [really irritated an important name of the PSP homebrew scene](https://gbatemp.net/threads/spoofix-v0-1-fix-the-9-90-issue-automatically.634398/#post-10185427), just because his homebrew from more than 10 years ago solved the same issue. No hate on him though, I just think that his actions were unnecessary.
## STEINS;GATE 0 RenPSP (Aug 30, 2023)
My attempt on porting Steins;Gate 0 to PSP using RenPSP. Also my first entry on a [gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/psp-monthly-game-jam-1)! Sadly it was at last place due to improper and rigged ratings. Inactive because there's so much work & the engine is unstable.
